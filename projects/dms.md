#### What is this?
It's a custom modular menu I've created for myself from the simple necessity of being able to spawn tools while in VR...
The menu became part of my character as it gives me access to various abilities, and a way to spawn avatars using the menu!

#### What can it do?
The first and most essential thing that this menu can do - spawn tools! The first submenu contains a list of the most
useful Resonite tools, like Dev Tool, ProtoFlux tool, Material Tool and Light Tool (when it's too dark).

The next submenu contains all my abilities I made so far:
- Soul Scan - which enables me to see where everyone is in the session
- Blink & Dask Gem - that lets me teleport and dash around the place
- Free Cam - that lets me detach from my body and fly around the world as if I'm in noclip
- Remote Grab - that lets me project my grabspheres in front of me and physically grab things that normally are too far away

And then the next most complicated thing on this menu - Summon Avatars, this system allows me to manage and summon avatars
from a huge list of avatars I've put into the menu. During summon, I can select if I want to just summon the avatar;
summon the avatar and switch into it; or summon the avatar, switch and delete the previous one

The management menu allows me to switch into any of the already spawned avatars, highlight where they are, or just delete
them without having to do it the conventional way

There's also some more useful things like access to avatar specific gems which usually include all the different toggles
I might have on the avatar. And there's a spotlight projected from the gem I can use to see in the dark, which optionally 
can be seen by others

#### What it took?
The initial rotary version of the menu was developed in 2 weekends, and ever since then I continued to update the menu
in different ways. Initially the menu supported only up to 8 items, but then to support the button based navigation, I
updated everything to use 9 items instead. The only things that had to be changed is how many items the UI should read,
and how many snappable points menu gems are supposed to have

#### What's next?
I plan to iterate on this menu once again, make it a lot more modular and less hardcoded to just me, so I can later release
it as a system others could use. I already had quite a few people ask me if they could have a version of it, but since
it's made specifically for me and my character, can't really share it that easily
