#### Why?

This site was made from the necessity of listing all the different projects I've created,
I'm interested in a lot of things and have been doing a lot of things, so having someplace where I
can list the projects is important.

The site was created with Next.js static builder, I'm very familiar with React when it comes to
web frontend, so it looked like the perfect choice. Project pages are just markdown files with metadata
tags on top of the file, I can easily add new projects to this portfolio by adding more markdown files to 
`projects/` folder.

The site is hosted with GitHub Pages, since the source code of this site is public, GitHub provides
free hosting for static pages.

Another benefit of hosting with GitHub Pages - GitHub Actions. Whenever a change is made to the repository,
GitHub automatically starts building and deploying actions to update the site.

#### What's next?

I'll keep listing more projects on this site as they appear (or I remember about them), I might
update the looks of the site in the future if I feel like it.
