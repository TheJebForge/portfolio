#### What is this?

This game was created during [GDU Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gdu-jam-4/rate/846462) and ended up in [Top 3](https://itch.io/jam/gdu-jam-4/results)
of the game jam tied with another submission, the game jam had a theme of '2020'. 

It's a mindbending puzzle game where your goal is to find the exit in 2020 centiseconds, in a location full of clever
tricks like seamless portals, ghost walls, and others. Each time you run out of time, you appear back at the starting
location, but as you progress, things seem to change accompanioned with an evolving soundtrack.

The game was created in Unreal Engine 4 and inspired by asthetics and some mechanics of [Antichamber](https://store.steampowered.com/app/219890/Antichamber/).

#### What I learned

I already had a lot of experience with Unreal Engine by then, but it was a nice opportunity to create some puzzle game
in a weekend!
